  A unique feature of the forest vegetation was the sight of tree trunks and branches lined with <em>epiphytes</em> â€” plants that grow on the surface of other plants, in a non-parasitic way. Our guides pointed out that bird droppings served as one source of this overgrowth, providing a kind of nutrient cocktail that coats the tree bark.
