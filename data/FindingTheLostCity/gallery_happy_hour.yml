  The local guides were no short of a sense of humor, and alluded several times to what they called "Happy Hour" â€” a stretch of uphill trail lasting about an hour if taken at a modest clip. It seems the name was selected to refer to one specific section, though curiously I recall encountering at least three such climbs.
