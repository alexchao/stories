  Our journey to Ciudad Perdida — the "Lost City" — began along the Rodadero beach of Santa Marta, Colombia's oldest surviving city and the rendezvous point for our 8-person party. Arriving on flights from New York, San Francisco, and Hong Kong, we checked into a modest beachfront hotel for a one-night stay, with less than 24 hours till the first step of the hike.
